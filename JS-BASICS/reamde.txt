As JavaScript is widely used in Web Development, in this article we would explore some of the Object Oriented mechanisms supported by JavaScript to get the most out of it. Some of the common interview question in JavaScript on OOPS includes,- “How Object-Oriented Programming is implemented in JavaScript? How they differ from other languages? Can you implement Inheritance in JavaScript and so on…”

There are certain features or mechanisms which makes a Language Object-Oriented like: 

Object
Classes
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Let’s dive into the details of each one of them and see how they are implemented in JavaScript.

1. Object– An Object is a unique entity that contains property and methods. For example “car” is a real life Object, which has some characteristics like color, type, model, horsepower and performs certain action like drive. The characteristics of an Object are called as Property, in Object-Oriented Programming and the actions are called methods. An Object is an instance of a class. Objects are everywhere in JavaScript almost every element is an Object whether it is a function, array, and string. 

2. Classes– Classes are blueprint of an Object. A class can have many Object, because class is a template while Object are instances of the class or the concrete implementation. 
Before we move further into implementation, we should know unlike other Object Oriented Language there is no classes in JavaScript we have only Object. To be more precise, JavaScript is a prototype based object oriented language, which means it doesn’t have classes rather it define behaviors using constructor function and then reuse it using the prototype. 

3. Encapsulation – The process of wrapping property and function within a single unit is known as encapsulation. Sometimes encapsulation refers to hiding of data or data Abstraction which means representing essential features hiding the background detail. Most of the OOP languages provide access modifiers to restrict the scope of a variable, but their are no such access modifiers in JavaScript but their are certain way by which we can restrict the scope of variable within the Class/Object

4. Inheritance – It is a concept in which some property and methods of an Object is being used by another Object. Unlike most of the OOP languages where classes inherit classes, JavaScript Object inherits Object i.e. certain features (property and methods)of one object can be reused by other Objects.
